# CPU-Scheduling-Simulator

## Overview

This repository contains a Java-based simulator for CPU scheduling algorithms. CPU scheduling is a fundamental aspect of operating systems, where the CPU decides the order in which processes are executed. This simulator allows users to visualize and analyze different scheduling algorithms such as First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job Next (SJN), Round Robin (RR), and more. 


## Environment Setup

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.
- Apache Maven
- Intellij or Eclipse

1. **Run the Simulator**:
   - Execute the main class in `src/main/` to launch the simulator's user interface.
   - Choose the desired CPU scheduling algorithm and input the process data.
2. **View Results**:
   - The simulator will display the sequence of process execution and calculate important metrics like waiting time, turnaround time, and CPU utilization.
